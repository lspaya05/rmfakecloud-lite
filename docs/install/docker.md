You can evaluate the program with:

```sh
docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/lspaya05/rmfakecloud-lite
```

To setup it for normal usage, you'll use need to setup a volume to store user configuration and documents:

```sh
docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 -p 8883:8883 -v ./data:/data -e JWT_SECRET_KEY='something' ghcr.io/lspaya05/rmfakecloud-lite
```

Explore others configuration variables on [the dedicated page](configuration.md).


## docker-compose file

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  rmfakecloud:
    image: ghcr.io/lspaya05/rmfakecloud-lite
    container_name: rmfakecloud
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
      - "8883:8883"
    env_file:
      - env
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
```

In this example, an external file named `env` is provided that contains the environment variables. Any of the [ways to set environment variables](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/set-environment-variables/) for docker compose will work.

For the possible environment variables, please have a look in the [configuration](configuration.md) section.

## Rebuild the image

You can use the script `dockerbuild.sh` or there is a `make` rule:

```sh
make container
```
